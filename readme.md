#base64 encoder-decoder\

encoder-decoder works\
image encoder wip\

changes:\
decoding finished, fixed the bug where it would output an empty string\
function arguments reduced to only actual inputs.\
image encoder almost finished\

NOTE: //image encoder works half the way, for some reason it adds unwanted paddings when compared to correct output\


todo: \
catching nulls \
back propogation \
c++ \
fix image encoder\
